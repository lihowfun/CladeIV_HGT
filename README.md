# HGT_CladeIV_PPN

This repository contains data related to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) analyses among Clade IV nematodes and plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN).

## Repository Structure

- `CladeIV/`
  - Contains alignment files, fasta sequences, and phylogenetic trees for Clade IV nematode species.
- `PPN/`
  - Contains alignment files, fasta sequences, and phylogenetic trees for plant-parasitic nematode species (PPN).

## Content Description

Each folder typically includes:
- **Alignment Files**: Multiple sequence alignments used for downstream analyses.
- **Fasta Files**: Nucleotide or protein sequence files for each studied species.
- **Phylogenetic Trees**: Precomputed tree files illustrating evolutionary relationships.

## Purpose

The data provided here support comparative studies of HGT events among Clade IV nematodes and plant-parasitic nematodes, facilitating evolutionary biology research.
